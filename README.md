Fikzar is a final year project for the University of the West of England that aims to make it easier for customers to find the nearest handyman, as well as a social networking site where they can chat and see the latest posts of handyman's latest jobs. The handyman's profile will include all of their contact information as well as the services they specialise in, as well as the ability to showcase their most recent work. When a customer searches for the work they want done, the app will connect them with the nearest handyman who can complete the task.â€ƒ
